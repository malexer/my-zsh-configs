# my-zsh-configs

My ZSH configuration.


# Usage

1. Install [zplug].
2. Copy `.zsh` and `.zshrc` to your home dir.


# Notes

1. [zplug] directory is assumed to be "~/.zplug", update ``.zshrc`` if
   you have another one. i.e. in case of installation via brew - in my
   case zplug was not working correctly when installed using brew.
